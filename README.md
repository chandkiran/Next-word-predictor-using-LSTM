This project involves training a model for word prediction using a corpus of natural language sentences. The goal is to predict the next word in a given sentence. The model is trained on sequences of words, where each word is treated as input to predict the subsequent word.LSTM models are being used.

## Example:

- **Input**: `"I"`
- **Output**: `"have"`

- **Input**: `"I have"`
- **Output**: `"eaten"`

- **Input**: `"I have eaten"`
- **Output**: `"food."`
